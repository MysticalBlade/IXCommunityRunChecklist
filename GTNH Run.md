### Bronze/Steam Age
- [ ] Alumite
- [ ] TiC Hammer
- [ ] Get to the bricked blast furnace (BBF)
	- [ ] Get steel
		- 1 block of coke consumed every 2400 sec
		- 1 block of coke gets made every 810 sec
- [ ] Get to the steam tier ore processing (steam grinder multi + steam oven multi)
- [ ] Go to twilight forest
- [ ] Tool upgrades
- [ ] Nether
	- Acquire sulphur there
- [ ] Get rubber source (stickreed and rubber trees)
- [ ] Get to high pressure steam
- [ ] Circuits
### LV
- [ ] Automate treefarm
- [ ] Deciding which powergen we're using
    - Steam
	- Oil
    - Some other obscure thing
- [ ] Starting LV Machines, get most LV machines to ease production
- [ ] EBF
- [ ] Polyethylene Line (2 Possible ways)
	- Oil
	- Saplings
### MV
- [ ] Upgrade Power (Keep Oil or Switch Benzene, or other)
- [ ] Finish Silicon Solar Grade Line
	- maybe automate raw silicon?
- [ ] Iron III Chloride Line
- [ ] Alumina from Clay Line
- [ ] Centralized Blast Furnace Center
- [ ] Maybe setup some sort of automation for more advanced circuits/components
	- basically the idea is go from boule to ULPICs, Integrated logic circuits and RAM chips
	- 1 MV cutting machine
	- 3 MV laser engravers
	- maybe limiting the amount we keep of each but wafers almost have no use elsewhere so prob just ignore
	- delay till AE
- [ ] Maybe fully automate circuits from ingots
	- we gonna delay this till AE
### HV
- [ ] get back into thaumcraft
	- [ ] Glieonia for glowstone = gold + redstone with EIO farming station
		- [ ] also should prob get sweed even if i do have a lot of oxygen already
	- [ ] Infusion
	- [ ] thaumic restorer for creative flight
		- longer term goal is to get up the grandmaster magic energy absorber for perma ev power for the AE system
			- Still kinda wanna do this but prob pointless with the nukes i'm planning
- [ ] Setting up actual ore processing
	- it's important to only fully process ores that have byproducts we give a shit about, stuff like platinum, gold, chrome, manganese etc)
- [ ] PTFE Line
	- this seems like a closed loop on hydrogen and chlorine, only needing carbon + fluor input
- [ ] Ruby Juice Line ( For chrome)
	- Also produces Aluminum from this so it's actually pretty good
	- This is prob not worth automating before AE i think i'll have enough chrome to come by without having to set this up, especially with LCRs later this will be much better
- [ ] Hydrogen Sulfide -> Sulfuric Acid Line
	- I have like 500+ buckets of potential sulfuric acid just being completely wasted atm sitting in a chest
		- but i might just process all the hydrogen sulfide i have and just use that because it will prob be enough before i swap fully to LCRs
- [x] Clean Room
- [x] Drilling rigs for rawa and heavy oil
- [x] Make 2 DTs for diesel and toluene

- [x] Cetane-boosted Diesel Line
	- [x] The Etanone line is pretty much done (missing a single hv distillery, an mv energy hatch and 3 HV combustion engines)
	- [x] need to figure out nitric acid line (ammonia despair + 1 extra lcr)
	- [x] atm it needs hand feeding of carbon for acetic acid and enderpearl dust for nitrogen for nitric acid
- [x] Vacuum Freezer
- [x] Process a good chunk of my ores for titanium
	- [x] need like 1 million liters of chlorine for this
- [x] EV
### EV
- [x] Titanium Pseudo-Automation
	- automate ore -> rutile -> TiTetrachloride -> Ingots
	- most important part is to make the recycle loop for the magnesium and carbon
- [x] Tungsten line
- [x] Swap Ebfs to EV power
- [x] AE?
	- [x] not really sure how bad the AE2 wall is the titanium i'm prepping might not be enough
		- made semi passive titanium line to solve this issue
	- [x] but the plan is to get at least a basic setup going for at least storage then start making all the machines for autocrafting at potentially start setting up on the new base (moving oil is going to be a huge pita unless i wanna run 2000+ blocks of pipeline)
		- WE DOING 600+ BLOCKS OF PIPELINE BABY!
	- [ ] maybe go back to thaum again to look up the magic absorbers to use the dragon egg to power ae passively but tbh the recipe looks like complete cancer till maybe late EV so skip it for now def
		- yep this is
			- 1 - complete cancer to craft
			- 2 - very debatably worth it especially since i plan on going nukes  
	- [x] number one thing is prob going to be circuit automation, i might even do that in this base before swapping, especially in the era of needing this many ev circuits this is going to make my life much easier
		- [x] yeah setting up the cleanroom on the new base is on the prio list
	- we definetely need to set up ore processing now, ae resource reqs are pretty bad especially for titanium which atm is ridiculously manual
		- plat line is like 1000000x worse need to setup either passive or active lines for both
- [x] Move to new base
	- [x] basic ae system 
	- [x] Power (Cetane-Boosted Diesel)
		- [x] set up raw oil drill
		- [x] set up machines for distilling into diesel
		- [x] set up tetranitromethane for CBD
	- [x] Basic automation/pattern creation
		- [x] from bender to wiremill, assembler, etc
			- [x] crafting cpu will prob require machines to atleast be powered before starting on crafting this
	- [x] Multi Smelter to replace steam oven
		- [ ] Pattern the multismelter (remember i have 64 parallels currently)
	- [x] EBF + Vac Freezer Subnet Floor
	- [x] Parallel Non-Consumable LCRs

		- [x] MV Circuit
		- [x] HV
		- [x] EV
	- [x] Plat Line
		- [x] TBH it's not 100% and there are some issues with reusing outputs directly but should be fixable with level maintainers but later on
			- [ ] added a level maintainer have problems with chlorine recycling loop, this can probably be solved by just throwing more calcium chloride into the system but needs testing

		- [x] Setup Industrial Centrifuge
		- [x] Setup Industrial Electrolyzer
		- [x] Setup Large Thermal Refinery
		- [x] Replace Stocking Busses with HV hatch + storage bus and see if that works because basic stocking bus is way too limited for oreprocessing tbh
		- [ ] Specialized Lines:
			- [ ] Tungsten Line
				- partial complete since i dont have a automated autoclave for tungstate but i'll just process scheelite for now
				- multi autoclave is locked till LuV so i actually might setup a dedicated IV single block autoclave to exclusively process tungstate into 
			- [ ] Titanium Line
			- [ ] Indium Line
				- [ ] Always process galena and sphalerite into indium solution (you get everything back just not byproducts of processing the purified ores more, which are silver and cadmium respectively)
	- [x] Methane Loop (might be not needed due to chloromethane)
- [ ] Proxy craft setup for recycling crafts
	- Very useful when PNCing oil refining in general for recycling unused byproducts
	- There are some specific cases where i need a byproduct for a very specific reason and almost all other times i wanna recycle it instead
		- dilluted sulfuric acid -> sulfuric acid but honestly sulfuric acid is so fucking cheap i think this is a complete waste of brainpower and resources, i'll still leave this here in case i discover another case where the byproduct is more relevant/expensive
- [x] Design IV power
	- Doing Nukes idea here is running either MOX if we can get an EEC running staballoy constructs because it's more power or run quad uranium cells otherwise
		- need to run the math on the freezers to support it
- [x] IV 
### IV

		- Not gated, titanium heavy
	- [x] Large Electric Compressor - get ASAP due to nuclear needs
		- Not gated just expensive 
	- [x] Large Fluid Extractor - get ASAP
		- Not gated but requires a crazy amount of tungstensteel, do not consider until robust ore processing
	- [x] Industrial Electrolyzer - get ASAP
		- [x] Needs stellite, gated behind HSS-G Coils
		- [ ] Already have one for ore processing but will prob want another one for on demand unless i can figure out of way to send the autocrafting byproducts to main net directly or use it for fluid recipes only for the moment
	- [x] Industrial Mixing Machine - get ASAP
		- Needs Staballoy (will get from the eec for the reactor)
	- [x] Precise AutoAssembler - Pray ore processing and crafting infra is enough soon
		- This multi is ridiculously expensive, theoretically i could make almost everything for it now but it would cost millions of materials, will consider this after heavy ore processing infrastructure
	- [x] Fluid Shaper - First thing to get after ABS

		- [x] Calcium Chloride
		- [x] Ruthenium Tetroxide
- [x] Get the PNC LCRs to IV power
- [x] Polybenzimidazole (the funny chemical)
	- the other potential thing to consider here is to try to swap most low tier rubber recipes with PBI since it's either a direct improvement to cost/output and/or allows us to centralize rubber for the rest of the game
- [x] Exxon Chemplant
	- [x] Fancy Rocket Fuel
- [x] Tier III Rocket
- [x] LVL 2 Thermal Protection
- [x] Vajra
- [x] Quantum Armor (will need it as a space suit)
- [x] Pattern the Multismelter

	- this allows me to completely finish the platline
	- list of things i will use a DT for
		- Acidic Osmium Solution - C#0 - 2 outputs
		- Hot Ruthenium Tetroxide Solution -  C#0 - 2 outputs
		- Lubricant - C#2 - 1 output
		- Heavy Fuel - C#0 - 3 outputs
		- Diluted Hydrochloric Acid - C#0 - 2 outputs
		- Distilled Water - C#0 - 1 Output
- [x] Staballoy EEC
- [x] Upgrade ore processing to IV power
	- note the thermal centrifuge is still ev due to it not wanting to form with 2 ev hatches but it's not used that much anyway so it will just stay liek that for now
- [x] PNC Precise Auto Assembler Automation
	- this is going to be next level cancer but it'll allow me to actually start patterning literally everything with the circuit swap design
	- pattern every single thing i craft no excuses this time, the era of hand crafting and hand feeding machines has to end now
- [ ] Universal Oil Cracker?
- [x] Drone Downlink
	- this uses cancer tier solar panels on the crafting recipe of the multiblock, i might just say fuck it and just roll without it till auto maintenance hatches
- [x] Mass Resource Collection Efforts
	- [x] the idea here is prob going to be setting up a quantum ring to bring power, drilling fluid and output the ores to, using a tier 2 drill with IV power this should make quick work of veins
	- [x] i have severely underestimated how much drilling fluid these plants eat, i have infinite stone and making it takes very little lube and water is infinite so i need to setup more robust mass production of the fluid
- [x] Setup a dedicated line of maceration stack + centrifuge into 2 super chests for the staballoy construct eec, atm it has no automation so i'm sitting on like 600k staballoy
- [x] Increase pattern sizes for the EBF crafts for platline, i'm getting bottlenecked by the crafts not detecting fast enough with very small amounts
	- [ ] and to be completely honest i need to rework how i'm doing my ebfs completely
- [x] Fix Oxygen and hydrogen source
	- [x] Hydrogen
		- [x] i need a better drill + dedicated electrolyzer and ender tank for chlorobenzene which solves both hydrogen and chlorine (and theoretically carbon but we have like 50k+)
	- [x] Oxygen
		- [x] i need an industrial greenhouse for oxygen using sweed
		- [x] i can also plant my glieonias in this green house as well to get infinite gold and redstone out of it
- [x] Mega VacFreezer
- [x] Pattern the ABS
	- 2
	- 4
	- 5
	- 6
	- 7
	- 8
- [x] Quad Volcanus
- [x] Material Press in forming press mode
- [ ] LuV LCRs (potentially also add another 4 lcrs)
	- it seems my bottleneck for platline also now includes the LCRs if i'm trying to maintain the entirety of it running at the same time
	- I've added 4 more lcrs to the setup and it seems to tear through most things atm, i'm actually being bottlenecked by cell count in some cases, i really need to rememeber to multiply some of the patterns due cell usage/scheduling of crafts efficiency
- [x] Maintained monaline
	- there are quite a few problems here mostly related to recipes with percentages on the main output i care about but i could theoretically pattern the precursors, process them then pattern the next steps until hitting the next percentage recipe
	- maintainer steps:
		- Dilluted Monazite Rare Earth Mud
		- Acidic Monazite Powder Dust
		- Ammonium Nitrate (allows me to do less weird maintainer spam and just shuffle the dust in my ore processing net)
		- Cooled Monazite Rare Earth Concentrate Dust
		- Samarium Dust
- [ ] Upgrade DT to dangote and go for all ME Hatches as well, it's the biggest bottleneck for platline
- [x] Upgrade circuits to advanced SMDs when monaline is finished
	- opinion changed on this, will wait for Crystalprocessors/CALs to swap
- [x] ASSLINE

- [x] T4 Rocket
- [x] LuV Assembler

	- [x] add another quad volc (after 64A ZPM Spine)
- [x] Change Power Spine to 64A ZPM
	- i will try to get at least 32 nukes running but i'm already losing my damn mind to this garbage inconsistent explosion bullshit so it's swapping to large naq as soon as humanly possible
- [x] ZPM AssLine
- [x] Upgrade LSC to 27 LuV Capacitors
- [x] Swap to much larger drives for storage
	- especially fluids like oxygen that i'm giga overproducing and am overflowing
	- the idea here is probably have sticky cards dedicated huge cells for main fluids then a lot of multi fluid cells of a decent size unfiltered for incidental fluid logistics, whenever a fluid becomes large scale use/storage, move it to a sticky cell
- [x] Naquadria Line
- [ ] Recycling for Low Quality Naquadria Sulphate Dust

			- [x] MKI
			- [x] MKII
			- [x] MKIII
		- [x] Lasers
			- [x] GIGA LSC
			- [x] Laser Backbone
				- Assuming i'm running 4 LNR with naq 2 + gelid cryotheum + atomic separation catalyst generating around 100m eu/t the smallest laser to consider is 1024A UV but since we get access to 16384A Laser hatches and they are relatively cheap compared to the other option we prob should just use them for future proofing
				- every LNR running a 1024A UV (or 4096A ZPM) out cause 256 will cap out on naq 3 already
				- [x] 16384A UV Laser Backbone
				- [ ] Laser Mirrors actually might be doable in UV but it will require this rework to be even possible to consider it before then
				- [ ] Same thing for wireless power, it might be doable in UV but most likely it's UHV
	- [x] Multiblock Placement Rework
		- the idea here is to have towers that can fit even the largest multiblocks that i might need more then 1 (currently this size looks like 15x15), and stack them up vertically and set them up with cribs (and when liquids are needed as input either make universal or interface into subnet storage busses), every tower should have it's own active transformer where the laser power will come in through (most machines until maybe much later or some specific cases will swap to wireless in UHV)
		- The initial design is a square of 9 16x16 (size might change) towers where the bottom middle is where power gen will be
		- floor heights are going to be variable due to some much larger multiblocks being tall like the fluid shaper
		- instead of a 9x9 square of towers i might make a 4x4 with gaps to try to fit a tower of compact fusions in the middle because that would look so fucking sick, also might make the sizes bigger then 16x16 to not be cramped with the big boi multis but we'll see
		- initial tower layouts (x,y - 0,0 is top left)

### UHV

	- [x] stainless steel bars and crystal matrix ingots
	- [x] stainless steel rods

- [x] Level Maintain living solder (it's piss slow)
- [x] Kevlar Bee
- [x] IoF
- [x] Mining Module mk2
- [x] Naq Refinery
- [x] Mk3-4 Naq Fuel
	- [x] thorium fuel depletion line for praseodymium
	- [x] t2 coils for mk4 are super infinity heavy but otherwise look relatively cheap
- [x] Fix Smelting
	- [x] add passive cosmic neutronium
- [x] Nanoforge
- [x] Nanoline (using samarium as base and praseodymium for the rest of the steps)
	- [x] Line Calculation
		- 1 samarium ore concentrate + 12k chlorine -> 1k samarium concentrate
			- 2s at ZPM has perfect OC
		- 1k sam concentrate + 1k sam nanoresin -> 1k filled sam nano + 1k chlorinated concentrate
			- 1s at UV has perfect OC
		- 1k chlorinated concentrate + 1k pras nanoresin -> 1k filled pras resin + 1k enriched chlorinate
			- 1s at UV has perfect OC
		- 1k enriched chlorinate + 1k pras nanoresin -> 1k filled pras resin + 1k dilluted chlorinate
			- 1s at UV has perfect OC
		- 1k dilluted chlorinate + 1k pras nanoresin -> 1k filled pras resin + 1k waste liquid
			- 1s at UV has perfect OC
		- 1k filled resin -> 3k chlorine + 144 pure resource + 1k nano resin
			- 5s at ZPM no perfect OC
			- so 1 ore concentrate will give 144 samarium and 432 praseodymium, scaling the digester to UEV will mean 20k sam concentrate a second meaning 20A UV on an MCR could take care of that, if pipelined correctly every step of the way should be consuming 20k nano resin a second, with 4 steps means 80k nano resin needs to be emptied every second, meaning we need 8 UHV electrolysers running non-stop to keep up
		- final setup is going to be 1 digester at UEV, 3 MCRs at 5A UHV (4A + nomal hatch), 8 electrolysers at UHV
		- this should give or take around 20 samarium a second and 60 praseodymium a second and cost essentially nothing

### Naq Power Math

- Naq 5
	- Atomic cata + Cryotheum
		- produces 17.5b eu/t per reactor
		- consumes 2 fuel a second
		- 1 ref using t3 coils produces 750 mk5 every 2.5s (300/s)
			- uses 250 heavy radox, 8 infinity dust, 32 atomic cata and 2000 mk4 (800/s)
		- 1 ref using t3 coils produces 250 mk4 every 0.1s (2500/s)
		- using the cheap recipe
			- 1 mk5 ref - 100 heavy radox, 3.2 infinity dust
			- 5 mk4 ref - cheap items
			- 8 mk3 ref - cheap items
		- this could power 100 reactors meaning 1.7t eu/t
